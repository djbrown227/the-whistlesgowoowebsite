# The Wisdom of Crowds in Sports Prediction 

## Overview

This website utilizes the principles of the "Wisdom of the Crowd" to provide sports gambling enthusiasts with crowd-sourced picks and predictions. By aggregating predictions from a diverse group of users, the platform aims to generate more accurate predictions than those made by individual bettors or even experts. The project draws inspiration from James Surowiecki's book "The Wisdom of Crowds," which explores how collective intelligence can lead to better decision-making.

## Motivation

The motivation behind this project is to leverage the collective knowledge and insights of a community of sports enthusiasts to beat the odds offered by sportsbooks. The concept is supported by the success stories of platforms like PredictIt and the famous anecdote of Francis Galton and the ox's weight at a county fair, as highlighted in Surowiecki's book.

## Features

- Users can submit their predictions for upcoming sports events.
- The platform aggregates predictions to generate consensus picks.
- Real-time feedback graphs are provided using WordPress and PHP, allowing users to see the performance of their predictions compared to the consensus and sportsbook odds.
- The website offers tools and resources to help users analyze data and make informed betting decisions.

## Technologies Used

- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Backend: PHP (WordPress)
- Database: MySQL
- Web Scraping: BeautifulSoup, Scrapy
- Machine Learning: scikit-learn, TensorFlow

## Wisdom of Crowds Principles

Surowiecki's book outlines several key principles for creating a wise crowd, which are applicable to this project:

1. **Diversity of opinion:** Each user should have unique information or insights.
2. **Independence:** User predictions should not be influenced by others.
3. **Decentralization:** Users should be able to specialize and contribute based on their expertise.
4. **Aggregation:** A mechanism is needed to combine individual predictions into a collective decision.
5. **Trust:** Users should trust the collective wisdom of the group.

## Applications

The concept of the Wisdom of Crowds has been successfully applied in prediction markets and Delphi methods. Prediction markets, such as Betfair and Intrade, have demonstrated the accuracy of aggregated predictions. The Delphi method, a systematic forecasting method using independent experts, has also proven effective in generating accurate predictions.

## Conclusion

This project aims to harness the collective intelligence of sports enthusiasts to improve sports betting predictions. By applying the principles of the Wisdom of Crowds, the website seeks to provide users with valuable insights and predictions for their betting decisions.
